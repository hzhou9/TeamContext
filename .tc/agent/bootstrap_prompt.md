Read the following TeamContext sources before coding:
- /Users/joe/Documents/TeamContext/.viking/agfs/shared/decisions
- /Users/joe/Documents/TeamContext/.viking/agfs/shared/patterns
- /Users/joe/Documents/TeamContext/.viking/agfs/shared/runbooks
- /Users/joe/Documents/TeamContext/.viking/index/index.txt
Latest sync snapshot:
- shared_files_scanned=6 | changed_files=2 | removed_files=0
If index.txt is missing, run `tc sync` first.
If decisions/patterns/runbooks are empty, report "no approved team context yet" and continue with code-level context.
Then do this before writing code:
- Summarize the constraints and decisions you will follow.
- List exactly which files you read.
- If context is missing or conflicting, ask clarifying questions first.
